# Explains how to generate analysers using the tool

# Explains the code and events (and also the code that handles inconclusivity)

* Specify a simple property and explain the synthesised code, giving an example of how the events are consumed and processed.

* Probably it will be the first property in the paper or else, the second one for which we have the automaton and we can show the corresponding code generated in Erlang.


# Must come after the RV section.


# Inconclusive verdicts and how they work
