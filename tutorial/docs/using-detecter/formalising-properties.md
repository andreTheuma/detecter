# Formalising Properties
---

## Explain each property



## Show how to synthesise one and discuss the generated code.

* The property of request count, but instead of the `exit` event use the `init` event of the process.

* Specify a simple property and explain the synthesised code, giving an example of how the events are consumed and processed.

* Probably it will be the first property in the paper or else, the second one for which we have the automaton and we can show the corresponding code generated in Erlang.
