# Verdict Explainability
---

## An example

Let us briefly review the property `prop_no_leak.hml`, that expresses:

> (P~3~)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The token `#!erlang 1` is *not* leaked by the server in reply to a client request.

```maxhml linenums="1"
with
  token_server:loop(_, _)
check
  [{_ <- _, token_server:loop(OwnTok, _)}]
  max(X.
    [{_ ? _}](
      [{_:_ ! Tok when OwnTok =:= Tok}]ff
      and
      [{_:_ ! Tok when OwnTok =/= Tok}]X
    )
  ).
```

The corresponding high-level description of the monitor generated by `#!erlang maxhml_eval:compile/2` is as follows.

```maxhml linenums="1"
{_ <- _, token_server:loop(OwnTok, _)}.rec X(
  {_ ? _}(
      {_:_ ! Tok when OwnTok =:= Tok}.no
      +
      NOT*{_:_ ! Tok when OwnTok =:= Tok}*.yes
    and
      {_:_ ! Tok when OwnTok =/= Tok}.X
      +
      NOT*{_:_ ! Tok when OwnTok =/= Tok}*.yes
  )
  +
  NOT*{_ ? _}*.yes
)
+
NOT*{A <- B, token_server:loop(OwnTok, _)}*.yes
```

In this high-level description, we use `+` to denote a mutually-exclusive choice between two branches of the monitor, and `NOT* ... *` to designate the monitor branch where *(i)* either the specified action pattern does not match the actual event from the trace, or, *(ii)* the pattern matches, but the Boolean constraint is not satisfied, given the data inside the variables contained in the pattern.
Parallel conjunctions are written as `and`, recursion is denoted by `rec`, and `yes` and `no` respectively denote the verdicts that monitors flag.


# Monitor reduction, step-by-step

Recall the monitor:

```maxhml linenums="1"
{_ <- _, token_server:loop(OwnTok, _)}.rec X(
  {_ ? _}(
      {_:_ ! Tok when OwnTok =:= Tok}.no
      +
      NOT*{_:_ ! Tok when OwnTok =:= Tok}*.yes
    and
      {_:_ ! Tok when OwnTok =/= Tok}.X
      +
      NOT*{_:_ ! Tok when OwnTok =/= Tok}*.yes
  )
  +
  NOT*{_ ? _}*.yes
)
+
NOT*{A <- B, token_server:loop(OwnTok, _)}*.yes
```

Let us assume that our *buggy* version of the token server exhibited the execution below. 
For this sequence of events, we describe the monitor reduction that explains how a verdict is reached.

```erlang linenums="1"
{trace,<0.84.0>,spawned,<0.82.0>,{token_server,loop,[1,1]}}
{trace,<0.134.0>,'receive',{<0.136.0>,0}}
{trace,<0.134.0>,send,1,<0.136.0>}
```

1.  The monitor analyses the event `#!erlang {trace,<0.84.0>,spawned,<0.82.0>,{token_server,loop,[1,2]}}` and it chooses the left  branch `{A <- B, token_server:loop(OwnTok, _)}` since the pattern matches, and its Boolean constraint `#!maxhml true` (elided) is always satisfied.
    The residual monitor with the instantiated data of `#!erlang OwnTok = 1`.

    ```maxhml linenums="1"
    rec X(
      {_ ? _}(
          {_:_ ! Tok when 1 =:= Tok}.no
          +
          NOT*{_:_ ! Tok when 1 =:= Tok}*.yes
        and
          {_:_ ! Tok when 1 =/= Tok}.X
          +
          NOT*{_:_ ! Tok when 1 =/= Tok}*.yes
      )
      +
      NOT*{_ ? _}*.yes
    )
    ```

2.  It then performs an internal transition to unfold the recursive variable `#!maxhml X` (expansion is not shown in the monitor due to space reasons).

    ```maxhml linenums="1"
    {_ ? _}(
        {_:_ ! Tok when 1 =:= Tok}.no
        +
        NOT*{_:_ ! Tok when 1 =:= Tok}*.yes
      and
        {_:_ ! Tok when 1 =/= Tok}.X
        +
        NOT*{_:_ ! Tok when 1 =/= Tok}*.yes
    )
    +
    NOT*{_ ? _}*.yes
    ```

3.  It analyses `#!erlang {trace,<0.134.0>,'receive',{<0.136.0>,0}}`, and choosing the left monitor branch.
    The left monitor branch matches any receive event, which means that the right branch matches no receive event.

    ```maxhml linenums="1"
      {_:_ ! Tok when 1 =:= Tok}.no
      +
      NOT*{_:_ ! Tok when 1 =:= Tok}*.yes
    and
      {_:_ ! Tok when 1 =/= Tok}.X
      +
      NOT*{_:_ ! Tok when 1 =/= Tok}*.yes
    ```

4.  At this point, the two conjuncted sub-monitors can evolve in parallel, given the trace event `#!erlang {trace,<0.134.0>,send,1,<0.136.0>}`.
    The left sub-monitor `#!maxhml {_:_ ! Tok when 1 =:= 1}.no + NOT*{_:_ ! Tok when 1 =:= 1}*.yes` chooses the left branch since the pattern matches and the Boolean constrain is fulfilled.
    The right sub-monitor `{_:_ ! Tok when 1 =/= 1}.X + NOT*{_:_ ! Tok when 1 =/= 1}*.yes` chooses the right branch since the pattern matches, but the Boolean constrain for the right branch is satisfied.
    This reduces the monitor to:

    ```maxhml linenums="1"
      no
    and
      yes
    ```

    The last internal computation leads the monitor to the rejection verdict `#!maxhml no`.

## Try this for yourself

detectEr Linear Time includes the function `#!erlang lin_analyzer:analyze_trace/2` to reduce a monitor, given a trace of events.
In this example, we use the monitor that we synthesised earlier for P~3~.
This is located in the script `props/prop_no_leak.hml`.

1.  First we invoke the main monitor function `#!erlang prop_no_leak:mfa_spec/1` to obtain the monitor instance.
    Since we need to match the pattern expected by `#!erlang mfa_spec`, *i.e.*, `#!erlang {token_server,loop,[_,_]}`, we can use any arguments we wish.
    In this example, we shall use `#!erlang 1` for both tokens.

    ```erl
    1> {ok, Mon} = prop_no_leak:mfa_spec({token_server,loop,[1,1]}).
    ...
    ```

    Note that `#!erlang prop_no_leak:mfa_spec/1` returns the tuple tagged with `#!erlang ok`, and we unwrap it accordingly to obtain the monitor in `#1erlang Mon`.

2.  Next, we create the trace to feed to the monitor as a list of events:

    ```erl
    2> Trc = [{trace,<0.84.0>,spawned,<0.82.0>,{token_server,loop,[1,1]}},
    {trace,<0.134.0>,'receive',{<0.136.0>,0}},
    {trace,<0.134.0>,send,1,<0.136.0>}].
    ```

3.  Finally the trace can be analyzed using the following invocation:

    ```erl
    3> {PdList, _}= lin_analyzer:analyze_trace(Trc, Mon).
    ```
    Variable `#!erlang PdList` contains the whole justification that details the steps taken by the monitor to reach the violation verdict `no`.

4.  The `#!erlang lin_analyzer` module also provides the means to pretty print the contents of the proof derivation list `#!erlang PdList`.

    ```erl
    4> lin_analyzer:show_pdlist(PdList).
    ```

Step `4` shows that the monitor is reduced using the following operational semantic rules:

1.  Rule *mChsL* on `#!erlang {trace,<0.84.0>,spawned,<0.82.0>,{token_server,loop,[1,1]}}`.
